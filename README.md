# PlainTextVault

PlainTextVault is an open-source tool for encrypting and decrypting plain text files using the AES-GCM encryption standard. It is designed to provide a simple command-line interface for securing sensitive information.

## Prerequisites

Before using PlainTextVault, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or later
- `pip` for installing Python packages
- `tmux` for session management

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thtskaran/PlainTextVault.git
   cd PlainTextVault
2. **Install Python Dependencies:**
Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

PlainTextVault includes an automation script `encrypter.sh` that uses `tmux` to create an isolated session for encryption and decryption tasks.

### Starting the tmux Session:

1. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x encrypter.sh
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./encrypter.sh

### Encryption:

- When prompted, choose option 1 and follow the instructions to encrypt your text. The encrypted data will be stored in the `vaults` directory.

### Decryption:

- Choose option 2 to decrypt a file. You will need to provide the path to the encrypted file and the passphrase used during encryption.

### Exiting the Session:

- After encryption or decryption, type `exit` to securely close the tmux session and ensure that no sensitive information is left in the terminal history.

## Long-Term Decryption

If you intend to decrypt files after an extended period, remember to:

- Securely store the passphrase and any other key material.
- Document the encryption process and parameters used.
- Regularly verify the integrity and accessibility of the encrypted data.

## Security Enhancements

PlainTextVault has been enhanced with additional security features:

- Passphrases are generated by the program and shuffled based on user input.
- Key derivation is performed using PBKDF2 with a high iteration count for added security.
- The `encrypter.sh` script uses `tmux` to isolate the encryption/decryption process from the main terminal session.

## No Warranty

PlainTextVault is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. It relies on external libraries, particularly the cryptography library for Python, and the security of the tool is heavily dependent on these libraries being used correctly and kept up to date.
