# PlainTextVault

PlainTextVault is an open-source tool for encrypting and decrypting plain text files using the AES-GCM encryption standard. It is designed to provide a simple command-line interface for securing sensitive information.

## Prerequisites

Before using PlainTextVault, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or later
- `pip` for installing Python packages
- `tmux` for session management

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thtskaran/PlainTextVault.git
   cd PlainTextVault
2. **Install Python Dependencies:**
Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

PlainTextVault includes an automation script `encrypter.sh` that uses `tmux` to create an isolated session for encryption and decryption tasks.

### Starting the tmux Session:

1. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x encrypter.sh
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./encrypter.sh

### Encryption:

- When prompted, choose option 1 and follow the instructions to encrypt your text. The encrypted data will be stored in the `vaults` directory. The encryption process uses AES-GCM, a secure symmetric encryption algorithm that ensures both the confidentiality and integrity of your data.

### Decryption:

- Choose option 2 to decrypt a file. You will need to provide the path to the encrypted file and the passphrase used during encryption. The decryption process reverses the encryption, restoring the original plaintext from the encrypted data, provided the correct passphrase is used.

### Exiting the Session:

- After encryption or decryption, type `exit` to securely close the tmux session and ensure that no sensitive information is left in the terminal history.

## Security Enhancements

PlainTextVault has been enhanced with additional security features:

- **Passphrases are generated by the program** and shuffled based on user input, making them highly resistant to dictionary attacks.
- **Key derivation is performed using PBKDF2** with a high iteration count for added security against brute-force attacks.
- **The `encrypter.sh` script uses `tmux`** to isolate the encryption/decryption process from the main terminal session, reducing the risk of sensitive information being accidentally exposed.

## Reducing Dictionary Attacks

PlainTextVault generates random words for passphrases instead of using common words or phrases. This approach significantly reduces the risk of dictionary attacks for several reasons:

- **Unpredictability**: Random words do not follow predictable patterns or structures that attackers can exploit, unlike common phrases or passwords.
- **Increased Complexity**: The inclusion of both uppercase and lowercase letters in random combinations adds complexity, increasing the number of possible passphrase permutations.
- **Lack of Semantic Meaning**: Since the words are randomly generated without semantic meaning, they are not found in dictionaries or common password lists used in attacks.

## Brute-Force Attack Timeframe

Assuming the use of a strong, randomly generated passphrase and a high iteration count in PBKDF2HMAC, brute-force attacks become exceedingly time-consuming and computationally expensive. For example, with a passphrase generated by PlainTextVault:

- **Complexity**: A 20-word passphrase, with each word randomly generated, results in an astronomical number of possible combinations.
- **Iteration Count**: A high iteration count, such as one million iterations, means that each brute-force attempt requires significant processing time.

Given these factors, even with substantial computational resources, cracking the encryption could take many years, if not longer. It's important to note that this assumes the cryptographic libraries used (e.g., for AES-GCM and PBKDF2HMAC) remain secure.

## User Responsibility

While PlainTextVault employs robust security measures, the ultimate security of encrypted data also depends on user practices. Key considerations include:

- **Secure Storage**: Do not store the passphrase and encrypted files (.val) in the same location. Use separate, secure storage solutions to minimize risk if one is compromised.
- **Passphrase Management**: Avoid sharing your passphrase or storing it in insecure locations. Consider using a password manager for secure storage.
- **Library Updates**: Ensure that all dependencies, especially cryptographic libraries, are kept up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities.

By following these practices and staying informed about security developments, users can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to their encrypted data. Remember, the security of your data is also your responsibility.
